# Trackr

The app that helps users take back control of their time. Trackr is a lightweight, straightforward way for users to log their time. It is a tool to reflect on how your time is actually spent, allowing you to make a change with intention. 

## Features

### Manage Activities
Create and manage reusable activities that you frequently do:
- Sleep
- Work
- Lunch
- Gym
- Downtime (TV, social media, etc.)

### Daily Reflections
End each day with intention. Answer reflection prompts like:

- "What are you grateful for?"

Close out your day mindfully and track your progress over time.
